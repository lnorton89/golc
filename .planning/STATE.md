# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-17)

**Core value:** An operator can author a modular show once, adapt its fixture pools to different deployments in one or two actions, and hand a simple controller surface to another person for reliable playback.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Offline Foundation and Delivery Traceability

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 10 (Offline Foundation and Delivery Traceability)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-07-20 - Completed quick task 260719-pgw: researched and recorded the three-controller MIDI acceptance set

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Recent roadmap constraints:

- [Phase 1]: Centralized configuration and credential-free, offline-capable Linear traceability begin before product feature work and remain gates throughout v1.
- [All phases]: UI, persistence, scripts, API, LLM, and Linear never own or block deterministic playback or Art-Net timing.
- [Phase 6]: Akai MIDImix, Novation Launch Control XL Mk2, and Worlde EasyControl 9 are the selected Phase 6 physical acceptance set for generic MIDI Note/CC learn and soft takeover; selection is not support, and MIDI-HW-02 requires independent per-device evidence for the exact hardware revision, firmware, Windows version, and GOLC build before a named claim.
- [Phase 10]: Windows is the only qualified and supported v1 platform; portability is preserved without macOS/Linux release claims.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- `MIDI-HW-01` RESOLVED 2026-07-19: Akai MIDImix, Novation Launch Control XL Mk2, and Worlde EasyControl 9 form the selected Phase 6 physical acceptance set; manual evidence is recorded in `Akai-MIDImix-UserGuide-v1.0.pdf`, `launch_control_xl_programmer_s_reference_guide.pdf`, `Novation-Launch Control XL GSG v2.pdf`, and `Worlde-EasyControl-9-UserManual.pdf`. Selection and manual review do not establish compatibility or support.
- `MIDI-HW-02` OPEN: independent physical acceptance is required for each device's exact hardware revision, firmware, Windows version, and GOLC build before any named compatibility or support claim; device-specific profiles and feedback remain under EXTN-04/v1.x.
- Linear remote mappings are intentionally pending and contain no invented IDs. Local planning remains authoritative and usable offline; credentials are not part of repository configuration.
- Deeper phase research is required for fixture/pool semantics, playback timing, Art-Net, TypeScript isolation, AI, and Windows qualification; targeted storage research and Wails/MIDI operator validation are also required.

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Platforms | macOS and Linux qualification | v2 | Roadmap creation |
| MIDI | Device-specific profiles and feedback | v1.x, gated independently per device by `MIDI-HW-02` and `EXTN-04` | MIDI-HW-01 resolution |
